Assignment 2

I worked for about 10 hours on this assignment. I originally had trouble figuring out what the appropraite syntax for handling the packets was. Then, I had
and still had up until submitting problems with being able to scan my 
VM. I got the error in which nmap claimed my vm was down, even though I could ping it. I tried everything listed on piazza and it didn't help. I know at the very beginning of my coding, though, that I got one nmap scan to work and it looked like my code caught a scan. So i'm hoping that is true!

I got some help from Ayal Pierce and Kezhi Wu for ths project. 

My code has a function for alerting the errors.

The main body of my code parses the packets from the internet connection.
First it checks all TCP packets for ones with flags marking a Null or Xmas scan.
Then it looks at all IP packets and uses regular exressions and pattern matching.
It searches for the pattern "Nmap", "pass", "PASS", and etc. for seeing if
the payload contains anything of interest.
